`Cashbox` provides an expressive and user-friendly interface for managing billing and payment verification services.
We believe that development should be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly rewarding.
`Cashbox` tries to ease development by simplifying the tasks of adding payment systems to a web application.

The project contains some ready-made solutions of payment systems, but you can offer your own.
